# OpenUP!

OpenUp is a social platform we created as part of our design course, Introduction to Human Computer Interaction (DES-101,IIITD). It is a safe space exclusively for boys who have faced sexual harassment, violence, or bullying. On OpenUp, boys can share their stories, support each other, connect with people who have similar experiences, and report issues to appropriate authorities if needed. We believe boys deserve to be heard and helped and should not suffer in silence or shame. OpenUp aims to empower boys to speak up, heal and grow.
